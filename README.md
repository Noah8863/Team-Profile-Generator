  ## Main problems faced when working on the project 
 
  The biggest issues I ran into was creating an HTML page using the data recieved by the user. I couldn't figure out how to use placeholders and how to call specific data points to fill those placeholders. 

  ## Main take aways from the project 

  I learned a more in depth understanding with how FS works and how tests work using Jest.

  Open up terminal and type in "npm test" to run the test files.
